# AgentDirectory - Product Requirements Document (MVP)

## Executive Summary

AgentDirectory is a B2B platform that organizes the AI tool landscape by role and use case instead of features, helping non-tech teams (Marketing, Sales, Operations, HR, Finance) discover and implement the right AI solutions. The MVP focuses on core functionality with minimal cost infrastructure, targeting launch in 4-6 weeks.

## Modular Development Approach

This project is structured for independent module development using Cursor AI. Each module has its own complete specification document:

### Module Documentation
- **[Architecture Overview](docs/PRD-Overview.md)** - High-level system architecture and integration patterns
- **[Module 1: Authentication](docs/PRD-Module1-Auth.md)** - Complete user authentication and profile management
- **[Module 2: Tool Directory](docs/PRD-Module2-Directory.md)** - Tool listings, search, and categorization
- **[Module 3: Admin & Reviews](docs/PRD-Module3-Admin.md)** - Admin panel and review system

### Development Workflow
1. **Start with Module 1** (Authentication) - No dependencies
2. **Build Module 2** (Tool Directory) - Depends on Module 1 APIs
3. **Complete Module 3** (Admin & Reviews) - Depends on Modules 1 & 2

Each module is completely self-contained with:
- ✅ Complete technical specification
- ✅ Database schema and API definitions
- ✅ Specific file structure
- ✅ Mock APIs for dependencies
- ✅ Testing strategy
- ✅ Deployment considerations

## Problem Statement

B2B teams outside of tech are drowning in AI tools with no way to cut through the noise. Marketing directors, sales VPs, and ops managers waste hours researching solutions that often end up unused due to:
- Overwhelming number of AI tools with feature-focused marketing
- Lack of role-specific guidance and implementation stories
- No clear integration difficulty ratings
- Missing step-by-step onboarding for non-technical users

## Solution Overview (MVP)

AgentDirectory organizes the AI landscape by role and use case, providing:
- Role-specific tool recommendations (VP Sales, Marketing Director, etc.)
- Basic implementation stories and ratings
- Simple integration difficulty indicators
- Basic filtering by role and use case
- User reviews and ratings

## Business Model (MVP)

### Revenue Streams (Phase 1)
1. **Basic Vendor Listings**: $99/month (simplified pricing)
2. **Future**: User subscriptions and premium features (see Backlog.md)

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Marketing Directors, Sales VPs, Operations Managers, HR Directors, Finance Teams
- **Secondary**: AI vendors seeking qualified leads
- **Initial Focus**: 5 roles (Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, HR, Finance)

## Technical Architecture (Low-Cost MVP)

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (same application)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (Free tier - 500MB)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (Free tier)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (Free tier - 1GB)
- **Search**: PostgreSQL Full-Text Search (built-in)
- **Email**: Resend (Free tier - 3K emails/month)
- **Payments**: Stripe (pay-per-transaction only)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (automatic deployments)

## Cost Breakdown (MVP)

| Service | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| Vercel Hobby | $0 |
| Supabase Free | $0 |
| Resend Free | $0 |
| Domain (amortized) | $1 |
| **Total** | **$1/month** |

### Usage Limits (Free Tiers)
- **Database**: 500MB (supports 10,000+ tool listings)
- **Storage**: 1GB (sufficient for logos/images)
- **Emails**: 3,000/month (adequate for early users)
- **Bandwidth**: Unlimited (Vercel + Supabase)

## Development Timeline

### Week 1-2: Module 1 (Authentication)
See [PRD-Module1-Auth.md](docs/PRD-Module1-Auth.md)
- Set up Supabase project and authentication
- Build user registration, login, profile management
- Implement role-based access control

### Week 3-4: Module 2 (Tool Directory)
See [PRD-Module2-Directory.md](docs/PRD-Module2-Directory.md)
- Create tool submission and management
- Build search and categorization
- Implement public tool browsing

### Week 5-6: Module 3 (Admin & Reviews)
See [PRD-Module3-Admin.md](docs/PRD-Module3-Admin.md)
- Build admin dashboard and tool approval
- Create review and rating system
- Add content moderation capabilities

## Integration Guidelines

### API Communication
All modules communicate through standardized API responses:

```typescript
// Success Response Format
{
  success: true,
  data: T,
  message?: string
}

// Error Response Format
{
  success: false,
  error: string,
  code?: string
}
```

### Database Isolation
- Each module owns specific database tables
- Cross-module access only through APIs
- No shared state between frontend modules
- Consistent naming conventions

## Launch Strategy

### Pre-Launch (Week 6)
1. Seed database with 50-100 AI tools manually
2. Create admin account and test workflows
3. Set up basic vendor onboarding process

### Launch (Week 7)
1. Deploy to production on Vercel
2. Basic marketing (social media, relevant communities)
3. Reach out to AI vendors for initial listings

### Post-Launch (Week 8+)
1. Gather user feedback and analytics
2. Monitor performance and usage
3. Plan next features from [Backlog.md](Backlog.md)

## Success Metrics (MVP)

### User Engagement
- Tool listings created and approved
- User registrations by role
- Search queries performed
- Reviews submitted

### Business Metrics
- Vendor sign-ups and conversions
- Tool approval rate and time
- User retention and activity

### Platform Health
- System uptime and performance
- Database query performance
- Search functionality effectiveness

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Scalability**: Supabase handles up to 50K monthly active users
- **Performance**: PostgreSQL search adequate for initial scale
- **Data Loss**: Supabase provides automatic backups

### Business Risks
- **Market Validation**: MVP approach with minimal investment
- **Feature Creep**: Strict focus on modular core functionality
- **User Adoption**: Manual seeding and community engagement

## Next Steps

### For Cursor Development
1. **Start with Module 1**: Use [PRD-Module1-Auth.md](docs/PRD-Module1-Auth.md)
2. **Each module is independent**: Complete specification in individual PRD files
3. **Context optimization**: Each module stays under 100k tokens
4. **Mock APIs provided**: For independent development and testing

### Future Expansion
- All advanced features documented in [Backlog.md](Backlog.md)
- Clear upgrade path from MVP to enterprise platform
- Modular architecture supports incremental feature additions

This MVP provides a solid foundation with minimal cost while enabling rapid development through modular, AI-assisted development with Cursor.
